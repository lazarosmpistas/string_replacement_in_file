# string_replacement_in_file
I run into a problem on running my VST on FL Studio, problem was the indexing was wrong and was pointing to a different user library, subsequently I could not use the user libraries. Made this script to mass replace a certain string in any file with another string. To use, run the script with the command "python string_replacer.py <old_filepath> <new_filepath> <string_to_change> <new_string>" in the command line. Use full filepaths ending WITH the file name AND its extension.
